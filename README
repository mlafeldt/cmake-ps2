CMake for PS2

The purpose of this project is to bring the powerful CMake build system to the
PS2 console.

CMake scripts are being developed for both PS2 processors - EE and IOP - getting
the most out of the PS2 toolchain.


Getting started

First, copy cmake/EE.cmake and cmake/IOP.cmake to
/usr/share/cmake-<VERSION>/Modules/Platform/.

Now you can build the samples:

$ cd cmake-ps2
$ ./build.sh <ee|iop> <sample source directory>


Status

There are already more or less working CMake scripts for EE including a
toolchain and a platform system file.

IOP support is in the works.
